# Buycraft PAPI Expansion
Based off the initial Math-expansion PAPI extension

Made from this initial reddit thread https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/f0xgau/buycraft_placeholders/
because no one else seemed to have anything created for this.

## placeholder
%buycraft_top%

## Installation
To install, throw it in your plugins/placeholderapi/extensions folder.
Put your buycraft secret key in the txt config it generates once used. Should be put into plugins/placeholderapi/buycraft-config.txt

Hope it's useful for anyone who needs it!
